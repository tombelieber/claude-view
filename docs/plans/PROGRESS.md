---

## Phase 3: Metrics Engine — DONE (Personal Tier, Enterprise-Grade)

Pure facts, no judgment. Collect atomic units, compute derived metrics, let users interpret.

**Part A — Backend (28 steps):** Migration 8, atomic unit extraction (user prompts, API calls, tool calls, files read/edited, re-edits, duration), skill invocation detection, pipeline integration, derived metrics (tokens/prompt, re-edit rate, tool density, edit velocity, read-to-edit ratio), git correlation (Tier 1-2), trends (week-over-week), index metadata, 7 new API routes (filter/sort, export, status, git sync), golden tests, edge case tests.

**Part B — Frontend (20 steps):** TypeScript type exports, 5 new hooks (useTrends, useExport, useStatus, useGitSync, extended useDashboardStats), MetricCard + DashboardMetricsGrid (6 cards with trends), RecentCommits, SessionMetricsBar, FilesTouchedPanel, CommitsPanel, SessionCard metrics row + time range, FilterSortBar with URL persistence, Settings page, StatusBar data freshness footer, loading states (Skeleton/ErrorState/EmptyState), accessibility audit (WCAG, Lucide icons, aria-labels, focus-visible), 6 E2E test files.

**15 commits, 224 backend tests passing, TypeScript compiles cleanly.**

**Key design decisions:**
- **No health labels** — Show metrics, not judgment (Smooth/Turbulent removed)
- **Atomic units** — Measure smallest provable units (prompts, files, tokens)
- **Derived on read** — Store atomic units, compute metrics in API layer
- **Ultra-conservative git** — Only Tier 1-2 (provable evidence), no fuzzy matching
- **UI/UX Pro Max** — Data-dense dashboard style, Fira fonts, Lucide icons

See `docs/plans/archived/2026-01-28-phase3-metrics-engine.md` for full plan.

---

## Phase 5: Enterprise Team Layer — Not Started

Multi-user aggregation and admin features. Transforms single-user analytics into team-wide insights.

**Scope:**
- Team/organization model (users belong to teams)
- Aggregated dashboards (team-wide health, commits, skills)
- Admin controls (who can see what)
- Manager views (employee AI fluency scoring)
- Compliance exports (CSV/PDF for HR audits)
- License validation (paid tier enforcement)

**Enterprise use cases:**
- "How is my team using Claude Code?"
- "Who are the most effective AI-assisted developers?"
- "What's the ROI on our Claude Pro seats?"
- "Export usage data for quarterly reviews"

Plan file: TBD (will be created when Phase 5 begins)

---

## Deferred: Analytical Database (Pre-Aggregation / DuckDB)

**Decision: Keep current SQLite approach. Revisit when building Enterprise tier.**

**Context (2026-02-03):** During deep index performance work, we evaluated whether to pre-aggregate session metrics (reduce ~168k turn/invocation rows → ~800 session-level rows) or switch to DuckDB for analytical queries.

**Current performance (release mode, 1.2 GB / 676 sessions):**
- Parse phase: 170ms
- Write phase: 290ms
- Total: 460ms
- Incremental re-index: <100ms

**Projections (release mode, linear extrapolation):**

| Dataset | Sessions | Parse | Write | Total |
|---------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1.2 GB (personal) | 676 | 170ms | 290ms | 460ms |
| 12 GB (work machine) | ~6,700 | ~1.7s | ~2.9s | ~4.6s |
| 50 GB (power user) | ~28,000 | ~7s | ~12s | ~19s |
| 100 GB (extreme) | ~56,000 | ~14s | ~24s | ~38s |

**Why defer:**
1. **Incremental indexing already solves the common case** — day-to-day re-index is <100ms regardless of total data size
2. **Full re-index is rare** — only on first run or `parse_version` bump (monthly at most)
3. **Cold start UX solves the perception problem** — 38s with a progress bar showing `2.7 GB/s` is acceptable; 38s with no feedback is not
4. **Pre-aggregation is a schema migration** — touches 6+ queries, changes data model. Better to design this into Enterprise tier from the start
5. **DuckDB adds a dependency** — separate engine, more binary size, more complexity for marginal gain at current scale
6. **SQLite handles up to 280 TB** — we're 1000x below the threshold where database choice matters

**When to revisit:**
- Enterprise tier design (Phase 5) — multi-user aggregation naturally requires pre-aggregated views
- If incremental re-index degrades (unlikely — it only touches changed files)
- If query latency on session list / dashboard becomes noticeable (currently <10ms)

---

## Deferred: App-Wide UI/UX Polish

**Decision: Batch all cross-cutting UI/UX concerns into a single phase after feature work completes.**

**Context (2026-02-05):** During Theme 3 design review, identified UI/UX polish items that apply across all features. Rather than address piecemeal per-feature, defer to a dedicated polish pass.

**Deferred items:**

| Category | Scope | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Accessibility (a11y)** | App-wide | WCAG 2.1 AA audit, color contrast, screen reader, keyboard nav |
| **Internationalization (i18n)** | App-wide | Extract hardcoded strings, locale files, insight templates |
| **Responsive design** | App-wide | Mobile/tablet breakpoints, touch targets |
| **Dark mode audit** | App-wide | Verify all new components respect theme |
| **Loading states** | App-wide | Consistent skeleton/spinner patterns |
| **Error states** | App-wide | Consistent error message UX |

**When to execute:**
- After Themes 1-4 feature work ships
- Before v1.0 release
- Single dedicated phase with checklist

**Why batch:**
1. Avoids context-switching during feature dev
2. Ensures consistency across all features
3. More efficient to audit once vs per-feature
4. Can test holistically (e.g., full a11y audit)
